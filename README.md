# friendly-data
Collection of useful data in easily digested formats

(barely started, nothing useful here yet -- the plan is to create a bunch of
source code snippets or CSV files that you can easily paste into your 5-minute
hacks, instead of reading up on convoluted APIs or merging half-compatible
data sources)
